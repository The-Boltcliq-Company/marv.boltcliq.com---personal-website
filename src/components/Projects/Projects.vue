                                    ERP”) is software that manages business processes for a company, organization, or in

                                    So how do ERPs “manage business processes?”

                                    The way it works is that ERPs feature multiple “applications,” or tools, that work
                                    together seamlessly to connect
                                    departments and bring the data from those various departments together into one
                                    database. Whatever task you need to
                                    complete — be it compiling a detailed year-end report or simply checking on the status
                                    of your Accounts Receivable —
                                    ERPs put all the information you need right at your fingertips.
